  ## Setup

      script/bootstrap

  ## Running It

      script/server

  airfoil-api will run on port `8080` by default. Use the `PORT` environment
  variable to use your own port.

  ### Forever

  airfoil-api has support for [Forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever). It uses `launchd` on OS X to kick it off so that it starts on boot.

  ### Development

  You can simply run it by calling `script/server`. This will run it in development mode with logging to standard out.

  ### Install as Service on OS X

      script/install
